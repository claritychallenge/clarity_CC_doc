The 2nd Clarity Enhancement Challenge is now complete. Results are shown below along with links to the system description papers. Further information can be found on the Clarity-CEC2-2022 workshop website [here](https://claritychallenge.org/clarity2022-CEC2-workshop/results).

import all_data from "/cec2_results.json";

The table below reports both the HASPI and listener intelligibility scores for all the submitted systems. The column 'Spkr. ID' and 'Head Rot.' indicate whether systems made use of the speaker identity and head rotation information, respectively. Links to the system reports are also provided.
