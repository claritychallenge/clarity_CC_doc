The 1st Clarity Prediction Challenge is now complete. Results are shown below along with links to the system description papers. Further information can be found on the Clarity-2022 workshop website [here](https://claritychallenge.org/clarity2022-workshop/results).

import all_data from "/cpc1_results.json";

The table below reports both the RMSE and the correlation coefficient (CC) between the predicted and actual intelligibility scores. Results are shown separately for the closed (systems seen during training) and open evaluation sets (systems not seen during training).The column 'intrusive' indicates whether the system is intrusive (i.e., requires access to the clean speech signal) or not. Links to the technical reports are also provided.
