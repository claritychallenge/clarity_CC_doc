- CPC2 Is coming soon!
:::

This second Clarity Prediction Challenge (CPC2) is about improving the automatic prediction of speech intelligibility to aid in the development of improved hearing aid algorithms. We need a prediction model that takes the audio produced by a hearing aid and the listener's characteristics (e.g. [audiogram](https://www.hear-it.org/Audiogram-)) and estimates the speech intelligibility score that the listener would achieve in a listening test. Additionally, we need algorithms that generalise well and work with audio that has been processed with range of enhancement algorithms, including thse which the system hasn't been trained on.

## Key dates (updated 14/01/22)
