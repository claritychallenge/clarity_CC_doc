### Software

All the necessary software tools are available as a single [GitHub repository](https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity).

We recommend installing the software first and then following the instructions in the repository's README for downloading and unpacking the data.

### Data

The data is available for [download here](https://mab.to/BndoGwtUhjTL3).

On the download site you will see the following packages are available,

- `clarity_CEC3_data.v1_0.tar.gz`  [**74 GB**] - data from Task 1 and Task 2
- `clarity_CEC3_task3_data.v1_0.tar.gz` - data from Task 3 (**to appear, 1st March**)

To unpack the data, use the following command:

```bash
tar -xvzf clarity_CEC3_data.v1_0.tar.gz
```

If unpacking more than one package, please unpack them in the same directory so that the unpackaged data is merged into the same root directory.
