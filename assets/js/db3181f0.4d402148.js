For simplicity, not all signal paths are shown. A scene generator (blue box) creates the speech in noise (SPIN) that the hearing aid model then enhances (yellow box). This enhancement is individualised for each listener, hence there is also a system to select a random listener (white ellipse) with a particular set of pure tone air-conduction thresholds or audiograms.","permalink":"/docs/cec1/software/cec1_baseline"}],"unlisted":false}')}}]);
