Not only does this make the task easier because the training and evaluation data are closely matched, it has also led to data that missing many of the complexities of real-world signals. In this task, we are moving closer to real world conditions by using signals that have been live-recorded over real microphones in a hearing-aid configuration worn by a participant listening to Clarity scenes reproduced over loudspeakers. This captures aspects of the problem that were previously neglected including complex head motions, real room acoustics, and real microphone characteristics.
