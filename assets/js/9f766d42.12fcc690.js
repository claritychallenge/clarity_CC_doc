We believe this is in part because the training data and evaluation data were fully simulated and produced with the same simulation tools. Evaluating in this way may favour systems that are able to exploit the consistency of the simulation, but which do not generalise well to real-world scenarios. So, in this first task, we are taking a small step towards greater realism by constructing an evaluate set using impulse responses that have been recorded in a real room, and which therefore cannot be so easily modelled by simulation."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"task-description",children:"Task Description"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The task considers the scenario of a hearing aid user listening to a target speaker in a domestic living room while two or three interfering sounds are also active.
