The evaluation dataset is now available to download from the myairbridge [download site](https://mab.to/I9mkGx4wsiiaX). The evaluation data filename is `clarity_CEC1_data.scenes_eval.v1_1.tgz`.

Full details of how to prepare your submission are now available on this site. Please read them carefully. 

**Registration**: Teams must register via the Google form on the [How To Submit](/docs/cec1/cec1_submission) page of this site. (Please complete this even if you have already completed a pre-registration form). Only one person from each team should register. Only those who have registered will be eligible to proceed to the evaluation. Once you have registered you will receive a confirmation email, a team ID and a link to a Google Drive to which you can upload your signals.

**Submission deadline**: The deadline for submission is the **15th June**. 

The submission consists of two components:

i) a technical document of up to 2 pages describing the system/model and any external data and pre-existing tools, software and models used. This should be prepared as a Clarity-2021 workshop abstract and [submitted to the workshop](https://claritychallenge.github.io/clarity2021-workshop/).

ii) the set of processed signals that we will evaluate using the MBSTOI metric. Details of how to name and package your signals for upload can be found on the [How To Submit](/docs/cec1/cec1_submission) page.

**Listening Tests:** Teams that do well in the MBSTOI evaluation will be notified on **22nd June** and invited to submit further signals for the second stage Listening Test evaluation.
