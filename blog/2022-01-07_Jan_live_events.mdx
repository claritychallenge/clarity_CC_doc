The Clarity team are hosting two live sessions this month related to the Prediction Challenge. Everyone is welcome to attend, whether or not you have registered to participate in the challenge or are still considering signing up.

**The presentations will be very similar to the webinar in November.** These events are intended as a chance for people in different time zones to attend live and ask the team questions.

Hosting is via Microsoft Teams. You can join from your browser without needing to install Teams, but if you join from a mobile device you may need to install the Teams app.
