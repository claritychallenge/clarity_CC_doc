We are pleased to announce the launch of the **[3rd Clarity Enhancement Challenge (CEC3)](/docs/cec3/cec3_intro)**.

The challenge follows on from the success of the [2nd Clarity Enhancement Challenge (CEC2)](/docs/cec2/cec2_intro) and is about improving the performance of hearing aids for speech-in-noise. The challenge extends CEC2 is three separate directions which have been presented as three different tasks.

- Task 1: Real ambisonic room impulse responses (:fire: LIVE :fire:)
- Task 2: Real hearing aid signals (:fire: LIVE :fire:)
- Task 3: Real dynamic backgrounds (launching 1st May)

Participants are welcome to submit to one or more tasks. We are particularly interested in systems that handle all three cases with little or no redesign/retraining.

The website has been fully updated to provide you with all the information you will need to participate. The necessary data and software are available for download.
