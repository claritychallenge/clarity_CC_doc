        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="some-comments-on-signal-alignment-and-level-insensitivity">Some comments on signal alignment and level-insensitivity<a href="#some-comments-on-signal-alignment-and-level-insensitivity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Some comments on signal alignment and level-insensitivity" title="Direct link to Some comments on signal alignment and level-insensitivity">​</a></h3><p>Our baseline binaural speech intelligibility measure in round one is the Modified Binaural Short-Time Objective Intelligibility measure, or MBSTOI. This short post outlines the importance of correcting for delays that your hearing aid processing algorithm introduces into the audio signals to allow MBSTOI to estimate the speech intelligibility accurately. It also discusses the importance of considering the audibility of signals before evaluation with MBSTOI.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="evaluation">Evaluation<a href="#evaluation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Evaluation" title="Direct link to Evaluation">​</a></h2><p>In stage one, entries will be ranked according to the average MBSTOI score across all samples in the evaluation test set. In the second stage, entries will be evaluated by the listening panel. There will be prizes for both stages. See this <a href="https://claritychallenge.github.io/clarity_CEC1_doc/docs/cec1_rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">page</a> for more information.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="signal-alignment-in-time-and-frequency">Signal alignment in time and frequency<a href="#signal-alignment-in-time-and-frequency" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Signal alignment in time and frequency" title="Direct link to Signal alignment in time and frequency">​</a></h2><p>If the signal processed by the hearing aid introduces a significant delay, you should correct for this delay before submitting your entry. This is necessary because MBSTOI requires alignment of the clean speech “reference” with the processed signal in time and frequency. This needs to be done for both ear signals.</p><p>MBSTOI downsamples signals to 10 kHz, uses a Discrete Fourier Transform to decompose the signal into one-third octave bands, and performs envelope extraction and short-time segmentation into 386 ms regions. Each region consists of 30 frames. These approaches are motivated by what is know about which frequencies and modulation frequencies are most important for intelligibility. For each frequency band and frame (over the region of which it is the last frame), an intermediate correlation coefficient is calculated between the clean reference and processed power envelopes for each ear. These are averaged to obtain the MBSTOI index. Thus is usually between 0 and 1, and rises monotonically with measured intelligibility scores, such that higher values indicate greater speech intelligibility. Alignment is therefore required at the level of the one-third octave bands and short-time regions.</p><p>Our baseline corrects for broadband delay per ear due to the hearing loss model. (The delay is measured by running a kronnecker delta function through the model for each ear.) However, the baseline software will not correct for delays created by your hearing aid processing.</p><p>Consequently, when submitting your hearing aid output signals, you are responsible for correcting for any delays introduced by your hearing aid. Note that this must be done blindly; the clean reference signals will not be supplied for the test/evaluation set.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="level-insensitivity">Level insensitivity<a href="#level-insensitivity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Level insensitivity" title="Direct link to Level insensitivity">​</a></h2><p>MBSTOI is level-independent, i.e., MBSTOI is broadly insensitive to the level of the processed signal because it is calculated using a cross-correlation method. This could be a problem because sounds that are below the auditory thresholds of the hearing impaired listener may appear to MBSTOI to be highly intelligible.</p><p>To overcome this, the baseline experimental code mbstoi_beta, in conjunction with the baseline hearing loss model, can be used to approximate hearing-impaired auditory thresholds. Specifically, mbstoi_beta adds internal noise that can be used to approximate normal hearing auditory thresholds. This noise, in combination with the attenuation of signals by the hearing loss model to simulate raised auditory thresholds, makes MBSTOI level-sensitive.</p><p>The noise is created by filtering white noise using pure tone threshold filter coefficients with one-third octave weighting, approximating the shape of a typical auditory filter (from Moore 2012, based on Patterson’s method, 1976). This noise is added to the processed signal. Note, the standard MBSTOI in the equalisation-cancellation stage adds internal noise to parameters, but this is an independent process.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="mbstoi">MBSTOI<a href="#mbstoi" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to MBSTOI" title="Direct link to MBSTOI">​</a></h2><p>The method was developed by Asger Heidemann Andersen, Jan Mark de Haan, Zheng-Hua Tan and Jesper Jensen (Andersen et al., 2018). It builds on the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) metric created by Cees H. Taal, Richard C. Hendriks, Richard Heusdens, and Jesper Jensen (Taal et al., 2011). MBSTOI includes a better ear stage and an equalisation-cancellation stage. For simplicity, the latter stage is not discussed here; see Andersen et al. (2018) for details.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h2><ul><li>Andersen, A.

The output of the hearing aid should be produced with a delay of less than about 10 ms. Many audio processing techniques are non-causal, i.e., the output of the system depends on samples from the future. Such processing is useless for hearing aids and therefore our rules include a restriction on the use of future samples.</p><p>The rules state the following:</p><ul><li>Systems must be causal; the output at time t must not use any information from input samples more than 5 ms into the future (i.e., no information from input samples &gt;t+5ms).</li><li>There is no limit on computational cost.</li></ul><p>Mathematically this is:</p><p>yn=f(xm , xm+1 ... xn+N–1 , xn+N , L )</p><ul><li>where yn is the output from your hearing aid for sample n.</li><li>x is the audio input signal from a hearing aid microphone.</li><li>N = 0.005 fs where fs is the sampling frequency.</li><li>m is a sample number where m &lt;= n.</li><li>L is the listener characteristics.</li><li>f() is the hearing aid function.

Example of how the limit of 5 ms is applied to a hearing aid input and output signal.
We have a chosen a limit of 5 ms because in a real hearing aid there will be other sources of delay (e.g., analogue-to-digital, digital-to-analogue conversion).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-is-there-no-limitation-of-how-long-f-takes-to-compute">Why is there no limitation of how long f() takes to compute?<a href="#why-is-there-no-limitation-of-how-long-f-takes-to-compute" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is there no limitation of how long f() takes to compute?" title="Direct link to Why is there no limitation of how long f() takes to compute?">​</a></h2><p>We’re trying to foster new approaches to hearing aid processing and decided that at this stage we will drive more innovation if we don’t restrict computation time for round one.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Improving hearing aid processing using DNNs blog. A suggested approach to overcome the non-differentiable loss function.</p><p>The aim of our Enhancement Challenge is to get people producing new algorithms for processing speech signals through hearing aids. We expect most entries to replace the classic hearing aid processing of Dynamic Range Compressors (DRCs) with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deep neural networks (DNN)</a> (although all approaches are welcome!). The first round of the challenge is going to be all about improving speech intelligibility.</p><p>Setting up a DNN structure and training regime for the task is not as straightforward as it might first appear. Figure 1 shows an example of a naive training regime. An audio example of Speech in Noise (SPIN) is randomly created (<em>audio sample generation</em>, bottom left), and a listener is randomly selected with particular hearing loss characteristics (<em>random artificial listener generation</em>, top left). The DNN Enhancement model (represented by the bright yellow box) then produces improved speech in noise. (Audio signals in pink are two-channel, left and right because this is for binaural hearing aids.)</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="schematic" src="/assets/images/clarity_schematic_for_blog-09-6f015d990f75f14a4068ca7ab8295f69.png" width="1149" height="446" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Figure 1</p><p>Next the improved speech in noise is passed to the Prediction Model in the lime green box, and this gives an estimation of the Speech Intelligibility (SI). Our baseline system will include algorithms for this. We’ve already blogged about the Hearing Loss Simulation. Our current thinking is that the intelligibility model will be using a binaural form of the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility Index (STOI) <!-- -->[1]<!-- -->. The dashed line going back to the enhancement model shows that the DNN will be updated based on the reciprocal of the Speech Intelligibility (SI) score. By minimising (1/SI), the enhancement model will be maximising intelligibility.</p><p>The difficulty here is that updating the Enhancement Model DNN during training requires the error to be known at the DNN’s output (the point labelled “improved SPIN”). But we don’t know this, we only know the error on the output of the prediction model at the far right of the diagram. This wouldn’t be a problem if the prediction model could be inverted, because we could then run the 1/SI error backwards through the inverse model.</p><p>As the inverse of the prediction model isn’t available, one solution is to train another DNN to mimic its behaviour (Figure 2). As this new Prediction Model is a DNN, the 1/SI error can be passed backwards through it using standard neural network training formulations.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="schematic" src="/assets/images/clarity_schematic_for_blog-10-7ee2dc89faab4e5ffb0ccb240d682e86.png" width="873" height="432" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This DNN prediction model could be trained first using knowledge distillation (<a href="http://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/56234/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this is something I’ve previous done for a speech intelligibility model</a>), and then the weights frozen while the Enhancement Model is trained. But there is a ‘chicken and egg’ problem here. The difficulty is generating all the training data for the prediction model. Until you train the enhancement model, you won’t have a representative examples of “improved SPIN” to train the prediction model. But without the prediction model, you can’t train the enhancement model.</p><p>One solution is to train the two DNNs in tandem, with an approach analogous to how pairs of networks are trained in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generative Adversarial Network</a> (GAN). iMetricGan developed by Li et al. <!-- -->[2]<!-- --> is an example of this being done for speech enhancement, although the authors weren’t trying to include hearing loss simulation. They aren’t the only ones looking at trying to solve problems where a non-differentiable or black-box evaluation function is in the way of DNN training <!-- -->[3][4]<!-- -->.</p><p>We hope our entrants will come up with lots of other ways of overcoming this problem. How would you tackle it?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h2><ul><li>[1]<!-- --> Andersen, A.H., Haan, J.M.D., Tan, Z.H. and Jensen, J., 2015.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How hearing aids address the problem of speech-in-noise in noisy and quieter places. We’ll also discuss what machine learning techniques are often used for noise reduction, and some promising strategies for hearing aids.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Tablet user" src="/assets/images/UoN_HS-08207-1536x1024-c3cb2429eb9f80e07fc15a97b1ede0c1.jpeg" width="1536" height="1024" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In a previous blog, we set out the problem of using hearing aids to pick out speech in noisy places. When the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)</a> is low, hearing aids can only do so much to improve the intelligibility of the speech.</p><p>A solitary hearing aid has various ways of addressing everyday constant noises such as cars, vacuum cleaners and fans. The aids work best when the noise is not too intrusive and SNR is relatively high. Problems arise when the noise is high (low SNRs), because then the hearing aid processing can distort the sound too much. While the hearing aid might have limited success in improving intelligibility in certain cases, they can still make the noise less annoying (e.g., Brons et al., 2014).</p><p>Using multiple microphones on each hearing aid can help in noisy conditions. The sound from the microphones is combined in a way that boosts the speech relative to the noise. This technology can be put into larger hearing aids, when there is enough spacing between the front and rear microphones.</p><p>One of the reasons why our brains are really good at picking out speech from the hubbub of a restaurant, is that it compares and contrasts the sounds from both ears. Our hearing is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">binaural</a>. Similarly, if you have a hearing aids in both ears, they work better if they collaborate on reducing the noise.</p><p>Crucial to how our brains locate sound and pick out speech in noise are timing and level cues that come from comparing the sound at both ears. When sound comes from the side:</p><ul><li>interaural time differences occur because the sound arrives at one ear earlier than the other.</li><li>interaural level differences occur because the sound has to bend around the head to reach the furthest ear.</li></ul><p>Binaural hearing aids communicate wirelessly and use noise reduction strategies that preserve these interaural time and level difference cues (e.g., Van den Bogaert et al., 2009). This allows the listener’s brain to better locate the speech and boost this compared to the noise.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="machine-learning">Machine learning<a href="#machine-learning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Machine learning" title="Direct link to Machine learning">​</a></h2><p>In recent years, there has been increasing interest in what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">machine learning</a> methods can do for hearing aids. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where computers learn directly from example data. One machine learning method is the neural network. This is an algorithm formed from layers of simple computational units connected to each other in a way that is inspired by connections between neurons in the brain. Deep (3+ layer) neural networks are able to learn complex, non-linear mapping functions, which makes them ideal candidates for noise reduction tasks.</p><p>We anticipate that machine learning can help tackle the challenge of speech in noise for hearing aids, providing a tailored solution for each individual and listening situation. For example, one thing machine learning could do is to sense the acoustic environment the listener is in, and choose the most suitable processing settings.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Electronic brain" src="/assets/images/neural_brain-5ff559452f28c8fa0d411e6e67baee7a.jpeg" width="400" height="320" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Image via <a href="http://www.vpnsrus.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.vpnsrus.com</a></p><p>In recent years, a machine learning approach for noise reduction has become popular. Neural networks are used to estimate time-frequency masks (a set of gains for each time-frequency unit that, when multiplied by the signal, produce less noisy speech; see, e.g., Zhao et al., 2018).</p><p>Machine learning systems for noise reduction are trained on artificially mixed speech and noise. Some operate on a single channel, i.e., using spectral cues, and some work with multiple channels using spatial cues. We expect that future hearing aids built on machine learning will perform best if they combine the left and right microphones to work binaurally.</p><p>Most of these noise reduction systems have been designed and evaluated in an off-line mode where they process pre-recorded signals. This isn’t much use for hearing aids that need to work in real-time with low latency (i.e., short delays). One challenge for hearing aids is to redesign off-line approaches to work quickly enough without too much loss of performance.</p><p>The potential for machine learning to produce better approaches to hearing aid processing is what motivated the Clarity Project.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People often have problems understanding speech in noise, and this is one of the main deficits of hearing aids that our machine learning challenges will address.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="cocktail party" src="/assets/images/cocktail_party-bffe47988f231d9d0811d899c5e6022e.jpeg" width="800" height="600" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It’s common for us to hear sounds coming simultaneously from different sources. Our brains then need to separate out what we want to hear (the target speaker) from the other sounds. This is especially difficult when the competing sounds are speech. This has the quaint name, The Cocktail Party Problem (Cherry, 1953). We don’t go to many cocktail parties, but we encounter lots of times where the The Cocktail Party Problem is important. Hearing a conversation in a busy restaurant, trying to understand a loved one while the television is on or hearing the radio in the kitchen when the kettle is boiling, are just a few examples.</p><p>Difficulty in picking out speech in noise is really common if you have a hearing loss. Indeed, it’s often when people have problems doing this that they realise they have a hearing loss.</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#bfc7d5;--prism-background-color:#292d3e"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">“Hearing aids don’t work when there is a lot of background noise.

However, surveys indicate that at least 40% of hearing aids are never or rarely used (Knudsen et al., 2010). A major reason for this is dissatisfaction with performance. Even the best hearing aids perform poorly for speech in noise. This is particularly the case when there are many people talking at the same time, and when the amount of noise is relatively high (i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low). As hearing ability worsen with age, the ability to understand speech in background noise also reduces (e.g., Akeroyd, 2008).</p><p>When an audiologist assesses hearing loss, one thing they measure is the pure tone audiogram. This assesses the quietest sound someone can hear over a range of frequencies. However, an audiogram only partly explains your experience with speech in background noise (Heinrich et al. 2015), because it only measures the quietest sound you can hear. For example, picking out speech from noise is a complex task for the brain to perform, and this cognitive ability isn’t assessed by an audiogram. In addition, there are other factors that are important such as personality, motivation, attitude toward hearing aids and prior hearing aid experience.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Audiogram" src="/assets/images/audiogram-50770c7ed479b289ea9fdca8ab2417d4.jpg" width="768" height="723" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>An audiogram displaying a “ski slope” pattern that is a sign of age-related hearing loss (source: Ronan and Barrett, BMJ, 2014).
Speech-in-noise tests get closer to the real-life problem a hearing aid is trying to solve. Listeners listen to speech in the presence of noise and write down what words they hear. More words correct show an increase in the ability to understand speech in specific noisy situations when listeners are wearing their hearing aid (aided) relative to when they are not (unaided). Of course, listening conditions in the clinic differ from real-life conditions.</p><p>Currently, while speech-in-noise test scores can be useful when fine-tuning a hearing aid, even then many users are disappointed about the performance of their hearing aids. Through our challenges, we hope to improve this situation, whether you go to cocktail parties or not.</p><p>What’s your experience with speech in noise?

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Clarity Project is based around the idea that machine learning challenges could improve hearing aid signal processing. After all this has happened in other areas, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) in the presence of noise. The improvements in ASR have happened because of:</p><ul><li>Machine learning (ML) at scale – big data and raw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPU</a> power.</li><li>Benchmarking – research has developed around community-organised evaluations or challenges.</li><li>Collaboration has been enabled by these challenges, allowing working across communities such as signal processing, acoustic modelling, language modelling and machine learning</li></ul><p>We’re hoping that these three mechanisms can drive improvements in hearing aids.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="components-of-a-challenge">Components of a challenge<a href="#components-of-a-challenge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Components of a challenge" title="Direct link to Components of a challenge">​</a></h2><p>There needs to be a common task based on a target application scenario to allow communities to gain from benchmarking and collaboration. Clarity project’s first enhancement challenge will be about hearing speech from a single talker in a typical living room, where there is one source of noise and a little reverberation.</p><p>We’re currently working on developing simulation tools to allow us to generate our living room data. The room acoustic will be simulated using <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/RAVEN%3A-A-real-time-framework-for-the-auralization-Schr%C3%B6der-Vorl%C3%A4nder/6977f2c2c1fb4cac2305e7965ee0da8192ced72d?p2df" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RAVEN</a> and <a href="https://uol.de/mediphysik/downloads/hearingdevicehrtfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Hearing Device Head-related Transfer Functions will come from Denk’s work</a>. We’re working on getting better, more ecologically valid speech than is often used in speech intelligibility work.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="baseline" src="/assets/images/baseline-1536x684-b7b4b9fdbaffe5d680f9dc1e0b073d7f.png" width="1536" height="684" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Entrants are then given training data and development (dev) test data along with a baseline system that represents the current state-of-the-art. You can find a post and video on the current thinking on the baseline here. We’re still working on the rules stipulating what is and what is not allowed (for example, will entrants be allowed to use data from outside the challenge).</p><p>Clarity’s first enhancement challenge is focussed on maximising the speech intelligibility (SI) score. We will evaluate this first through a prediciton model that is based on a hearing loss simulation and an objective metric for speech intellibility. Simulation has been hugely important for generating training data in the <a href="https://chimechallenge.github.io/chime6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHIME challenges</a> and so we intend to use that approach in Clarity. But results from simulated test sets cannot be trusted and hence a second evaluation will come through perceptual tests on hearing impaired subjects. However, one of our current problems is that we can’t bring listeners into our labs because of COVID-19.</p><p>We’ll actually be running two challenges in roughly parallel, because we’re also going to task the community to improve our prediction model for speech intelligibility.</p><p>We’re running a series of challenges over five years. What other scenarios should we consider? What speech? What noise? What environment?
